    "notes": "## 0.10.0 - 2024-04-04\nYou can find the release announcement [here](https://uiua.org/blog/uiua-0.10.0).\n### Language\n- **Breaking Change** - Multiline strings are now also *raw strings* which do not require escaping\n  - They are no longer format strings by default\n  - Raw strings can be made format strings with an extra `$`, i.e. `$$ \u2026`\n- **Breaking Change** - [`try \u2363`](https://uiua.org/docs/try)'s handler function is now passed the original arguments *before* the error\n- [`try \u2363`](https://uiua.org/docs/try) now works with function packs of more than 2 functions\n  - This tries each function in the pack in order\n- Switch functions now format to use `\u27e8\u27e9` brackets\n  - This makes them easier to identify when reading\n  - It also allows switch functions to be used as modifier arguments without extra nesting\n- Switch functions now work with [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)\n- Add pattern matching with [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)\n  - Constant values can now be inverted to form a function which errors if the top value on the stack does not match\n  - Format strings can be inverted to extract substrings\n  - Read more in the new [Pattern Matching](https://uiua.org/tutorial/patternmatching) tutorial\n- Git modules are no longer experimental\n  - Modules are added automatically as Git submodules when imported\n  - See the [Modules](https://uiua.org/tutorial/modules#git-modules) tutorial for more information\n- [`map`](https://uiua.org/docs/map) and related functions [`insert`](https://uiua.org/docs/insert), [`has`](https://uiua.org/docs/has), [`get`](https://uiua.org/docs/get), and [`remove`](https://uiua.org/docs/remove) are no longer experimental\n- Add the [`mask \u29b7`](https://uiua.org/docs/mask) function, which creates a mask of occurrences of one array in another\n  - This works similarly to [`find \u2315`](https://uiua.org/docs/find), but is better when you need a mask or to distinguish between adjacent occurrences\n- Change [`sine \u223f`](https://uiua.org/docs/sine)'s glyph\n  - `\u223f` is more representative of what it does\n  - Most circle glyphs like `\u25cb` are used for array functions or stack manipulation\n  - `\u25cb` will continue to work and will be formatted as `\u223f`\n- [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) [`join \u2282`](https://uiua.org/docs/join) now works with arrays of the same rank as long as the row count does not change\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`scan \\\\`](https://uiua.org/docs/scan) now works with [`equals =`](https://uiua.org/docs/equals) and [`not equals \u2260`](https://www.uiua.org/docs/not%20equals)\n- [`group \u2295`](https://uiua.org/docs/group) can now take multidimensional index arrays\n- [`partition \u229c`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) can now take multidimensional marker arrays\n- [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) and [`pick \u22a1`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) now work with duplicate indices if the values at those indices are the same\n- [`rotate \u21bb`](https://uiua.org/docs/rotate) now works through boxes\n- [`fold \u2227`](https://uiua.org/docs/fold) now works with [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) if its function does\n- [`inventory \u235a`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory) can now take 3 or more arrays\n- [`repeat \u2365`](https://uiua.org/docs/repeat) can now take non-scalar repetition counts\n  - This repeats the function a different number of times for each row of the inputs\n- [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) can now be used with [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) to separate into [`classify \u229b`](https://uiua.org/docs/classify) and [`deduplicate \u25f4`](https://uiua.org/docs/deduplicate)\n- Characters can now be [`multiply \u00d7`](https://uiua.org/docs/multiply)d or [`divide \u00f7`](https://uiua.org/docs/divide)d by numbers to possibly toggle their case\n- Add the [`csv`](https://uiua.org/docs/csv) function, which encodes and decodes CSV data\n- Add the [`&clget`](https://uiua.org/docs/&clget) and [`&clset`](https://uiua.org/docs/&clset) system functions, which allow copying and pasting text to and from the system clipboard\n- Add more [shadowable constants](https://www.uiua.org/docs/constants)\n- Importing modules that use the `# Experimental!` comment now requires the `# Experimental!` comment in the importing file\n- Doc comments may now be placed at the end of single-line functions\n- Non-alphabetic identifiers can now be suffixed with `!` to make macros\n- Add `df`, `ddf`, etc shortcuts for [`dip \u2299`](https://uiua.org/docs/dip) [`fix \u00a4`](https://uiua.org/docs/fix)\n- Existing macros are now called \"stack macros\" to distinguish them from the new \"array macros\"\n  - Stack macros are now [hygienic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro)\n- Add array macros, which allow code to be generated and manipulated at compile time as strings\n  - These are specified with a `^` immediately following a binding's arrow\n  - They are documented in the [Macros](https://uiua.org/tutorial/macros) tutorial\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`pop \u25cc`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop) can now be used to retrieve the [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) value\n  - See more details in [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill)'s documentation\n- Add the wildcard constant `W`, which matches any number, and `@\\W`, which matches any character\n  - These work well with [`match \u224d`](https://uiua.org/docs/match), [`find \u2315`](https://uiua.org/docs/find), and [`mask \u29b7`](https://uiua.org/docs/mask)\n- Add the experimental [`coordinate \u27d4`](https://uiua.org/docs/coordinate) function, which searches an array for a value and returns a multidimensional index\n  - [`coordinate \u27d4`](https://uiua.org/docs/coordinate) is to [`pick \u22a1`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) as [`indexof \u2297`](https://uiua.org/docs/indexof) is to [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select)\n- Experimental function strands now use the `\u203f` character, which formats from `__`\n- Add the experimental [`by \u22b8`](https://uiua.org/docs/by) modifier, which duplicates a function's last argument before calling it\n- Add the experimental [`quote`](https://uiua.org/docs/quote) modifier, which converts a string to code at compile time\n  - This is useful in array macros\n- Add `# No inline!` semantic comment, which prevents a function and its callers from being inlined\n  - This enables better stack traces on errors\n- Deprecate [`bind`](https://uiua.org/docs/bind)\n  - It undermines the priniciples of the language\n  - It makes certain optimizations impossible\n  - [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) and/or [`map`](https://uiua.org/docs/map) can be used to achieve similar effects\n- Deprecate [`deal`](https://uiua.org/docs/deal)\n  -

Instead, multiple groups are passed to the function.\r\n  - The reducing versions were rarely used\r\n  - This new behavior is more useful\r\n- **Breaking Change**: [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`json`](https://uiua.org/docs/json) no longer attempts to form multidimensional arrays\r\n  - This makes deserializing JSON more consistent\r\n- **Breaking Change**: [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill)ed [`scan \\\\`](https://uiua.org/docs/scan) now sets the initial value as well as filling row shapes\r\n  - This behavior is hard to get otherwise\r\n  - Fixes to existing code should be simple\r\n- **Breaking Change**: [`obverse \u2305`](https://uiua.org/docs/obverse) with a single function now just nullifies the inverse\r\n  - This makes a lot of common [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) patterns much simpler\r\n- **Breaking Change**: Negative indices to [`pick \u22a1`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) and [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) now always use a fill value if available\r\n- Stabilize [subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts)!\r\n  - They make available a lot of nice functionality\r\n  - Allow negative subscripts\r\n  - Add experimental [sided subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts#sided)\r\n- [`rows \u2261`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows), [`inventory \u235a`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory), and [`each \u2235`](https://uiua.org/docs/each) now support subscripts\r\n- [`deshape \u266d`](https://uiua.org/docs/deshape) now supports subscripts\r\n  - Axes are collapsed to get the given rank\r\n- Deprecate [`rerank \u2607`](https://uiua.org/docs/rerank)\r\n  - It was basically always used with a static rank, and that functionality has been subsumed by subscripted [`deshape \u266d`](https://uiua.org/docs/deshape) and/or the iterating modifiers listed above\r\n  - The dynamic behavior can still be accessed with `\u00b0\u22b8(\u29fb\u25b3)` (though when you would need this is unclear)\r\n- Add the [`stencil \u29c8`](https://uiua.org/docs/stencil) modifier, which is a generalization of [`windows \u25eb`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)\r\n  - `\u29c8\u2218` is equivalent to [`windows \u25eb`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)\r\n  - [`windows \u25eb`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows) has been deprecated. All existing uses will continue to work and will be formatted as `\u29c8\u2218`.\r\n- [`get`](https://uiua.org/docs/get), [`has`](https://uiua.org/docs/has), and [`remove`](https://uiua.org/docs/remove) now support working on multiple key-value pairs at once\r\n- Deprecate [`trace \u2e2e`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)\r\n  - It is equivalent to subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack)\r\n  - Sequential `?`s, which formatted to [`trace \u2e2e`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)s, now format to subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack)\r\n- Stabilize [`tuples \u29c5`](https://uiua.org/docs/tuples)\r\n- Stabilize [`sort \u2346`](https://uiua.org/docs/sort)\r\n  - Sorting is a very common operation, and it's useful to have such simple access to it\r\n- Stabilize [`last \u22a3`](https://uiua.org/docs/last)\r\n  - Getting the last row is a very common operation\r\n- Stabilize [`case \u2369`](https://uiua.org/docs/case)\r\n- Add the [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path) modifier, which finds shortest paths\r\n  - Replaces and deprecates [`astar`](https://uiua.org/docs/astar)\r\n  - `astar`'s functionality is still available via [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path) with a function pack\r\n- Add the `A\u2081`, `A\u2082`, `A\u2083`, `C\u2082`, `C\u2083`, and `E\u2083` constants which are various kinds of adjacency offsets\r\n  - They are great for working with [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path)\r\n- Declared signatures that do not match the inferred signature will now cause a warning rather than an error\r\n  - The function is edited to make the signature correct\r\n- [`orient \u2938`](https://uiua.org/docs/orient) can now use [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) to fill in new dimensions\r\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce) (format string) now splits a string by a delimiter\r\n- [`do \u2362`](https://uiua.org/docs/do) now runs its functions at least once, even if their signatures are invalid\r\n  - This is helpful when initially setting up a loop\r\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) now works with [`repeat \u2365`](https://uiua.org/docs/repeat) without a repetition count\r\n  - This counts the number of repetitions required to converge\r\n- Add an `\u03b5` shadowable constant for the machine epsilon\r\n  - You can type it as `\\\\epsilon`\r\n  - Other greek letters can also by typed this way\r\n- Add [`&ep`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ep) and [`&epf`](https://uiua.org/docs/&epf) system functions for easier printing to stderr\r\n- Functions that work with audio such as [`audio`](https://uiua.org/docs/audio) now treat the first axis as samples and the second axis as channels\r\n- Add [`# Deprecated!`](https://uiua.org/docs/semanticcomment#deprecated) semantic comments\r\n- Change [`backward \ud834\udd08`](https://uiua.org/docs/backward)'s glyph to `\ud834\udd08`. Code using `\u02dc` will continue to work and will be formatted as `\ud834\udd08`.\r\n- Add the experimental [`or \u2228`](https://uiua.org/docs/or) function\r\n  - It has a useful reduction identity\r\n  - It is also GCD\r\n- Add experimental [inline macros](https://www.uiua.org/docs/experimental#inline-macros)\r\n  - Deprecate the experimental `stringify` and `signature` modifiers in favor of inline code macros\r\n- Add experimental [`binary`](https://uiua.org/docs/binary) function, which encodes and decodes arrays into a compact binary representation\r\n- Add experimental [`&b`](https://uiua.org/docs/breakpoint) function, which pauses execution and prints the stack\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated `member \u220a` function\r\n  - As planned, [`memberof \u220a`](https://uiua.org/docs/memberof)'s glyph has been changed, and the old one will format to `\u220a`.\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `\u27d4 coordinate` function\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `struct` modifier\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated `setinv` and `setund` modifiers\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated `choose` and `permute` functions\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `\u25f9 triangle` modifier\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `\u2444 chunks` function\r\n### Interpreter\r\n- The compiler and interpreter have been almost entirely rewritten to use a tree-based execution model rather than a bytecode model\r\n  - This massively simplifies compilation as well as optimizations and the derivation of inverses\r\n  - This should not affect any language semantics\r\n- Improve pattern matching error messages\r\n- Optimize the \"root\" pattern `\u207f%:1`\r\n- Optimize format strings applied to strings or boxed strings\r\n- Optimize common [`partition \u229c`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) patterns\r\n- Add an `-e`/`--experimental` flag to the `uiua eval` command to enable experimental features\r\n- Add the `uiua check` command, which checks that Uiua files compile\r\n- More system functions are now run for output comments\r\n- Improve formatting of more complex arrays with format strings and [`&p`](https://uiua.org/docs/&p)\r\n### Website\r\n- Add a new pad setting to show line values to the right of the code\r\n- Add [Subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts) page\r\n- Update [More Stack Manipulation](https://uiua.org/tutorial/morestack) and [More Array Manipulation](https://uiua.org/tutorial/advancedarray) tutorials to include subscripts\r\n  - Change their titles from \"Advanced\" to \"More\"\r\n- Add new [Idioms](https://uiua.org/docs/idioms) page\r\n"

This makes its calling convention match [`memberof \u220a`](https://uiua.org/docs/memberof)\n  - It also matches the argument order of the more common case\n  - [`indexof \u2297`](https://uiua.org/docs/indexof) has been deprecated\n  - The formatter will automatically convert existing code\n- Deprecate experimental [`progressive indexof \u2298`](https://uiua.org/docs/progressiveindexof) in favor of [`occurrences \u29c6`](https://uiua.org/docs/occurrences)\n- Add the [`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential) function, which computes the exponential function\n- Deprecate [`logarithm \u2099`](https://uiua.org/docs/logarithm) in favor of [`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential)\n- Deprecate [`unique \u25f0`](https://uiua.org/docs/logarithm) in favor of subscripted [`occurrences \u29c6`](https://uiua.org/docs/occurrences)\n  - `\u25f0` will automatically format to `\u29c6\u2081`\n- Remove experimental `ln` in favor of [`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential)\n- Add [`&seek`](https://uiua.org/docs/&seek) function for working with large files\n- Calling [`&tcpa`](https://uiua.org/docs/&tcpa) on a TLS listener created with [`&tlsl`](https://uiua.org/docs/&tlsl) now automatically tries conducting a TSL handshake\n- Make subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack) merge adjacent non-subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack) chains\n- Implement [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)[`regex`](https://uiua.org/docs/regex) for replacing using regex (called `gsub` in some other languages)\n- Add functions to work with UDP:\n  - [`&udpb`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udpb) to bind a socket\n  - [`&udpr`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udpr) to receive a datagram\n  - [`&udps`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udps) to send a datagram\n  - [`&udpsml`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udpsml) to set the maximum message length\n- Rename `\u25ff modulus` to [`modulo \u25ff`](https://uiua.org/docs/modulo)\n  - \"Modulo\" is the correct term for the operation this function conducts\n- Add [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) and [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) capability to [`&cd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&cd)\n  - [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`&cd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&cd) will output the current working directory\n  - [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)[`&cd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&cd) will return to the original directory afterward\n- Add experimental [`reciprocal \u2a2a`](https://uiua.org/docs/reciprocal) function, which computes the multiplicative inverse AKA reciprocal of a number\n- Add experimental [`recur`](https://uiua.org/docs/recur) modifier, which generalizes recursive algorithms\n  - This would replace existing recursive functions\n- Add experimental [data functions](https://www.uiua.org/docs/experimental#data-functions) with optional arguments\n  - Remove existing experimental non-tacit data functions and methods\n  - [`layout`](https://uiua.org/docs/layout) and [`voxels`](https://uiua.org/docs/voxels) now use this system for configuration\n- `@\\_` and `@\\W` now roundtrip through [`pretty`](https://uiua.org/docs/pretty) and [`repr`](https://uiua.org/docs/repr) (previously they would be formatted as `@\\x\u00af01` and `@\ufffd` respectively)\n- Remove previously deprecated `signature` and `stringify` modifiers\n### Interpreter\n- Many bug and crash fixes\n- Emit a diagnostic when most modifiers are not provided enough arguments\n- Emit a diagnostic for redundant subscripts\n- [`below \u25e1`](https://uiua.org/docs/below) now accepts noadic and dyadic functions\n  - An advice/style diagnostic will be emitted\n- Speed up the implementation of [`or \u2228`](https://uiua.org/docs/or)\n- The fomatter no longer truncates trailing decimal `0`s from number literals\n- Implement filled adjacent [`stencil \u29c8`](https://uiua.org/docs/stencil)\n- Optimize `=1\u29fb\u25f4`\n- Remove `rkok` alias and change `kork` to format to `\u25bd\u2082`\n- Add `each` alias for `\u2261\u2080`\n- Add `elem` alias for `\u220a`\n- Add `log` alias for [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential)\n- Add `set` alias for [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`by \u22b8`](https://uiua.org/docs/by)\n- Improve \"Array would be too large\" error messages\n- Change short form of the `--experimental` flag for `uiua eval` to use `-x` instead of `-e`\n  - This is consistent with the corresponding flag for `uiua repl`\n- Remove the `\u207f\u00f7:1` (\"root\" pattern) optimization\n  - It inverted incorrectly when used with [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)\n  - Existing uses should be replaced with [`anti \u231d`](https://uiua.org/docs/anti)[`power \u207f`](https://uiua.org/docs/power)\n### Pad\n- Add `primitives.json` to the pre-included files in the pad\n"

J9.5.0-beta1 was released 20230423.\n\n## Changes to the J engine\n\n* [List of problems fixed from J9.4](/wiki/System/BugReports/Bugs/Fixed#Fixed_after_release_9.4)\n\n**Summary of Changes to the J Language in the release**\n\n* **new primitive:** [u m. n](/wiki/Vocabulary/mdot) performs the operation u(*mod* n), i. e. using ***modular arithmetic***.  n and any arguments to the derived verb must be tolerantly integral or extended integer; results will be integer or extended integer; u must be one of + - *\u00a0% ^\u00a0%. (-/ . *).  The derived verb has only dyadic valence except for (% m. n) and (%. m. n) which are bivalent.\n* **domain of x\u00a0;: y expanded**: new actions added.\n* **New foreign**: ([x] [15!:18](/wiki/Vocabulary/Foreigns#memalign) y) creates a block with value y but with the data area aligned to a cacheline boundary\n* **Language extension**: (x { y) where x is a boxed numeric array now allows >x to have any rank.  Each 1-cell of >x is the index list of a cell of y\n* **Incompatible language restriction**: In (x m} y), m must be an atom.For compatibility with previous versions of J, the **deprecated** forms (<\"0 *numeric-array*)} and (<\"1 *numeric-array*)} are still supported (see below)\n* **Incompatible language change**: the inverse of m&{ is removed.  If you need this inverse, use the inverse of m&C. instead.\n* **Language extension**: u&.v y now accepts certain noninvertible v that can be assigned a notional inverse for a given y.  Details [here](/wiki/Vocabulary/ampdot#structural); notable is u&.(m&{) y which modifies m{y, in place if possible.\n\n** J9.5.0-beta9 (the final beta) **\n\n* **Language extension**: u&.v y now accepts certain noninvertible v that can be assigned a notional inverse for a given y.  Details [here](/wiki/Vocabulary/ampdot#structural); notable is u&.(m&{) y which modifies m{y, in place if possible.\n\n** J9.5.0-beta8 **\n\n* complex division rewritten, faster and not giving NaN error when dividing by _j_\n* complex arithmetic (+ - *\u00a0%) supported by AVX2 instructions\n* **Incompatible language change**: the inverse of m&{ is removed.  If you need this inverse, use the inverse of m&C. instead.  This change is in anticipation of defining u&.(m&{) y to modify specified cells of y.\n\n** J9.5.0-beta7 **\n\n* fix bug introduced in beta-4\n\n** J9.5.0-beta6 **\n\n* (<<<x) { y rewritten again, faster and less memory\n* x m} y fast paths added when m selects a single cell and y is a direct type\n\n** J9.5.0-beta5 **\n\n* **New foreign**: ([x] [15!:18](/wiki/Vocabulary/Foreigns#memalign) y) creates a block with value y but with the data area aligned to a cacheline boundary\n* **Language extension**: (x { y) where x is a boxed numeric array now allows >x to have any rank.  Each 1-cell of >x is the index list of a cell of y\n* **Incompatible language restriction**: In (x m} y), m must be an atom.For compatibility with previous versions of J, the **deprecated** forms (<\"0 *numeric-array*)} and (<\"1 *numeric-array*)} are still supported (see below)\n\nDiscussion: (x m} y) where m contained multiple boxes was slow, sometimes very slow.  Moreover the boxes in m were required to select regions of the same shape, making the apparent generality of boxed m illusory.  Restricting boxed m makes all the forms faster.\n\nThe supported multibox forms are **deprecated** and may be removed in a future version.  You can update your code to use an atomic box as follows:\n\n* x (<\"0 *numeric-array*)} y should be replaced with x (<<*numeric-array*)} y\n* x (<\"1 *numeric-array*)} y should be replaced with x (<*numeric-array*)} y (or x *numeric-array*} y if you know that *numeric-array* has rank > 1)\n\nIf you have other multibox forms and need help rewriting them, send a message to the beta forum.\n\nTo see a warning when a deprecated form is executed, use [9!:55](/wiki/Vocabulary/Foreigns#deprecate).\n\n** J9.5.0-beta4 **\n\n* x { y recoded.  Multidimensional indexing is faster, much faster for rank>2; virtual blocks are used more often; x overwritten in place where possible; complementary indexes faster and less space\n* x m} y now supports doubly-boxed selectors with an efficient path\n* q: y recoded for 64-bit, faster\n\n** J9.5.0-beta3 **\n\n* #@> y supported by special code\n* improvements to inverses containing constant functions\n\n** J9.5.0-beta2 **\n\n* x m} y now has Integrated Rank Support.  x m}\"n y, formerly deprecated, is now recommended.\n* **domain of x\u00a0;: y expanded**: new actions added.  This code was contributed by Danil Osipchuk.\n* 0\u00a0% m. n 0 is 0\n* -/ . * m. n calculates *modular determinant*.  This code was contributed by Cliff Reiter.\n* complementary indexing (triple-boxed selectors) faster\n\n** J9.5.0-beta1 **\n\n* 0!:n (used by the load and script verbs) discards the first line of a file if the first two characters in the line are #!\n* x integer_atom&|@^ y recoded, about 2x faster\n* special code for (x -@{`[`]} y (also with @:), which changes the sign of the addressed cells of y, when y is floating-point.  Supports inplacing.\n* **new primitive:** [u m. n](/wiki/Vocabulary/mdot) performs the operation u(*mod* n), i. e. using ***modular arithmetic***.  n and any arguments to the derived verb must be tolerantly integral or extended integer; results will be integer or extended integer; u must be one of + - *\u00a0% ^\u00a0%..  The derived verb has only dyadic valence except for (% m. n) and (%. m. n) which are bivalent.The code for %. m. n was contributed by Cliff Reiter.\n\n## Changes to the base system\n\n## Changes to the Qt IDE\n\n* Jqt on Windows and macOS now uses Qt 6.5.3\n\n>>\u00a0[<<](/wiki/System/ReleaseNotes)\u00a0[Pri](/wiki/Help/Primer/Primer_Contents)\u00a0[JfC](/wiki/Help/JforC/Jforc_Contents)\u00a0[LJ](/wiki/Help/Learning/Learning_J)\u00a0[Phr](/wiki/Help/Phrases/Phrases_Contents)\u00a0[Dic](https://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/contents.htm)\u00a0[Voc](https://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/vocabul.htm)\u00a0[!:](https://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/xmain.htm)\u00a0[Rel](/wiki/System/ReleaseNotes)\u00a0[NuVoc](/wiki/NuVoc)\u00a0[wd](/wiki/Guides/Window_Driver)\u00a0[Help](/wiki/Help)\u00a0[S](/wiki/ShareMyScreen)"

Formerly time spent preprocessing the sentence (including word formation, parsing parenthesized primitives, and setting up for debug) was included in the overall time.  The reported time is now quite precise even for very short sentences, provided you [run6!:2in the correct environment](/wiki/Vocabulary/Foreigns#timesentence).\n* Protection of names in execution rewritten.

This code was contributed by Marcin \u017bo\u0142ek.\n* **incompatible language change**: rank of q: changed to _ 0 0.  With the monadic rank 0, as formerly, fill produced invalid results.

They caused confusion.  Rewrite as x (m v ])^:[ y and x u&n@]^:[ y.\n* During debug suspension, reloading a name in execution is now allowed without error if the value is not changed.

An option on [18!:3 y](/wiki/Vocabulary/Foreigns) allows for creating an impermanent named locale.\n* **coerase** (18!:55) has no effect on permanent locales.  To get the same effect, you must manually delete all names from the locale and reset its Bloom filter.  Supporting the very rare case of deleting a named locale is not worth the burden it imposes on a multithreaded system.\n\n** J9.6.0-beta9 **\n\n* **18!:4 removed** except as documentation.  The cover functions **cocurrent** and **coclass** perform the same function they always did, but the underlying 18!:4 itself, which had a quirky definition, can no longer be used directly.\n* Execution of named functions rewritten, simpler & faster\n* If you delete the implied locale, the implied locale is set to z (previously you were left with no implied locale and no path)\n\n** J9.6.0-beta8 **\n\n* Warning message given if 18!:4 is used.  18!:4 will be removed from beta9.\n* Improvements to the debugger and its interaction with Jqt and JHS, contributed by Marcin \u017bo\u0142ek\n\n** J9.6.0-beta7 **\n\n* Beta users should install this beta before installing later betas.

For additional information regarding the features mentioned below, see:\n\n* the release notes for Dyalog v19.0 ([PDF](http://docs.dyalog.com/19.0/Dyalog Version 19.0 Release Notes.pdf))\n* the release notes for Link v4.0 ([GitHub](https://dyalog.github.io/link/4.0/ReleaseNotes40/))\n* the list of enhancements/fixes in RIDE v4.5 ([GitHub](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride/milestone/5?closed=1))\n\n## Highlights of Dyalog Version 19.0\n\nDyalog v19.0 makes it easier to install and maintain your APL system, and to develop and deploy applications built upon it. It:\n\n* runs on new hardware and software platforms.\n* helps to make your APL production systems more robust through:\r\n\nimproved error handling.\nbetter support for collaboration between independent multi-threaded applications.\nan experimental Health Monitor, which allows the monitoring of large collections of Dyalog processes.\n* provides better support for external source code management systems and continuous integration pipelines.\n* contains many other features to increase developer productivity, including a package manager.\n\n* improved error handling.\n* better support for collaboration between independent multi-threaded applications.\n* an experimental Health Monitor, which allows the monitoring of large collections of Dyalog processes.\n\n## 64-bit ARM Support (macOS and Raspberry Pi)\n\nDyalog v19.0 adds native support for 64-bit ARM-based chips, including:\n\n* Apple\u2019s M1, M2, and M3 chips (running macOS)\n\n* Amazon Graviton chips, available from Amazon Web Services\n* 64-bit Raspberry Pi running Pi OS BookWorm\n\n## .NET 8.0 Support\n\nThe.NET interface is getting closer in capability to the .NET Framework interface. Most importantly, Dyalog v19.0 allows you to create .NET assemblies and executables using .NET (v8.0 \u2013 LTS version) in addition to the .NET Framework (v4.8).\n\n**NOTE:** We expect to continue to support both .NET and the .NET Framework for the foreseeable future, although it is likely that some future functionality may not be provided for the .NET Framework. Although some productivity tools make use of .NET functionality, our policy is that the APL interpreter itself will never become dependent on .NET or any other application framework.\n\n## Production Systems in APL\n\nDyalog v19.0 provides better support for scaling your applications and constructing applications from components developed completely independently:\n\n* Improved WS FULL handling ensures that your event handling will be successful even in situations where the interpreter has (almost) completely run out of memory.\n* A new system function, \u2395TALLOC, allows independent components to safely use tokens for thread synchronisation without knowledge of each other.\n* The interpreter exposes an [experimental Health Monitor protocol](https://github.com/Dyalog/HMon) that can be used to monitor the status of large collections of APL processes.\n\n## Source Code, Package Management, and Continuous Integration\n\nContinuous Integration (CI) is a process in which changes to source code trigger automatic builds, running of tests, and, in some cases, deployment of new code. Dyalog v19.0 includes [Link version 4.0](https://github.com/dyalog/link/), which allows you to base APL development on text files rather than binary workspaces; this makes it easy to make use of state-of-the art toolchains for source code management and CI.\n\n## Tatin Packages\n\nDyalog v19.0 comes with built-in support for [Tatin](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Tatin), the APL community's package manager. Most tools for APL developers that Dyalog implements in APL are now available as [open-source repositories on GitHub](https://tatin.dev/v1/packages), and an increasing number are also appearing as Tatin packages.\n\nAlthough these packages are released independently of new releases of Dyalog, it is worth mentioning the following new packages that we have developed or enhanced during the Dyalog v19.0 release cycle:\n\n* [HttpCommand](https://tatin.dev/v1/packages/major_versions/dyalog-HttpCommand) \u2013 an HTTP client for APL\n* [Jarvis](https://tatin.dev/v1/packages/major_versions/dyalog-Jarvis) \u2013 our Web Service framework\n* [NuGet](https://tatin.dev/v1/packages/major_versions/dyalog-NuGet) \u2013 a tool for consuming .NET NuGet packages from Dyalog\n\nYou can monitor our progress at [https://tatin.dev/v1/group-homepage?name=dyalog](https://tatin.dev/v1/group-homepage?name=dyalog).\n\n## Developer Productivity\n\nAs usual, Dyalog v19.0 contains many new features intended to make APL developers more productive. For example:\n\n* \u2395NCOPY and \u2395NMOVE now provide an option for an APL callback function to be invoked during execution. This allows the programmer to monitor and/or report progress when processing a lot of data.\n* The *Recurse* variant option for \u2395NINFO has been extended to limit the level of sub-directories to be searched.\n* \u2395NINFO has been extended to provide file times as UTC Dyalog Date Numbers.\n* File Components >2GB in size can now be compressed using LZ4 compression.\n* \u2395FHOLD now accepts an optional left argument to specify a time-out.\n* The HTMLRenderer provides a number of new Properties and Methods \u2013 AllowContextMenu, ExecuteJavaScript, GetZoomLevel, IsLoading, LoadEnd, and SetZoomLevel.\n* Multi-line input, which was introduced in Dyalog v18.0, is now enabled by default. This allows the definition of multi-line dfns directly in the APL session.\n* Session log files are now saved in JSON format.\n* Lines output to the Session that are associated with errors are now syntax-coloured using the error colour for the selected Session colour scheme.\n* [RIDE](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride) v4.5, which is released with Dyalog v19.0, has many usability improvements including a redesigned startup screen.\n\nVisit the [Documentation Centre](https://www.dyalog.com/documentation_190.htm) for the documentation for Dyalog v19.0.\n\n[Download Dyalog version 19.0](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm)\n\n[Prices and Licences](https://www.dyalog.com/prices-and-licences.htm)(new users only \u2013 current users will be contacted directly with upgrade information)\n\nDownload the [Dyalog version 19.0 highlights](uploads/documents/Dyalog_V190_highlights.pdf) as a PDF"

    "notes": "# Introduction\n\nThis document describes the requirements for installing Dyalog v20.0 and the functionality changes in Dyalog v20.0 compared with Dyalog v19.0.\n\n## Release Highlights\n\nKey enhancements in Dyalog v20.0 include the following:\n\n* Array notation, a literal syntax for most arrays (including nested and high-rank arrays) and namespaces, has been introduced. Array notation allows you to write and manipulate literal arrays in a way that was not possible before.\n* Namespace manipulation and data extraction has been made easier with the addition of `\u2395VGET` and `\u2395VSET`, and extensions to `\u2395NS`. These changes are particularly useful when dealing with namespaces generated by applying `\u2395JSON` to JSON requests from webservices, as default values can be specified to mitigate the effects of missing members.\n* The two common patterns `(f Y) g Y` and `(f X) g Y` can now be represented by the new compositional operator *behind* ( `\u235b` ).\n* `\u2395SHELL` enables execution of external programs with more control and options than those provided by `\u2395SH`/`\u2395CMD`.\n* Expressions can now be evaluated primitive-by-primitive using inline tracing, while accessing arguments and results of each function along the way.\n\nFor more information on these and other changes introduced in Dyalog v20.0, see [New and Enhanced Features](../new-enhanced/).\n\n## Tools\n\nSome of the tools that are supplied with Dyalog or can be downloaded separately have independent version numbers; new versions of some of these tools are released in parallel with new versions of the interpreter. For Dyalog v20.0, these include:\n\n* Conga v3.6\n* HTTPCommand v5.9 GitHub repository \u2013 [https://github.com/Dyalog/HttpCommand](https://github.com/Dyalog/HttpCommand/) Documentation \u2013 [https://dyalog.github.io/HttpCommand/5.9](https://dyalog.github.io/HttpCommand/5.9/)\n* Link v4.1 GitHub repository \u2013 [https://github.com/Dyalog/link](https://github.com/Dyalog/link/) Documentation \u2013 [https://dyalog.github.io/link/4.1](https://dyalog.github.io/link/4.1/)\n* Ride v4.6 GitHub repository \u2013 [https://github.com/Dyalog/ride](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride/) Documentation \u2013 [https://dyalog.github.io/ride/4.6](https://dyalog.github.io/ride/4.6/)\n* SALT v2.9\n* SQAPL v6.5\n* User Commands v2.7\n\nChanges to tools are not included within these Release Notes."
