    "notes": "## 0.10.0 - 2024-04-04\nYou can find the release announcement [here](https://uiua.org/blog/uiua-0.10.0).\n### Language\n- **Breaking Change** - Multiline strings are now also *raw strings* which do not require escaping\n  - They are no longer format strings by default\n  - Raw strings can be made format strings with an extra `$`, i.e. `$$ \u2026`\n- **Breaking Change** - [`try \u2363`](https://uiua.org/docs/try)'s handler function is now passed the original arguments *before* the error\n- [`try \u2363`](https://uiua.org/docs/try) now works with function packs of more than 2 functions\n  - This tries each function in the pack in order\n- Switch functions now format to use `\u27e8\u27e9` brackets\n  - This makes them easier to identify when reading\n  - It also allows switch functions to be used as modifier arguments without extra nesting\n- Switch functions now work with [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)\n- Add pattern matching with [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)\n  - Constant values can now be inverted to form a function which errors if the top value on the stack does not match\n  - Format strings can be inverted to extract substrings\n  - Read more in the new [Pattern Matching](https://uiua.org/tutorial/patternmatching) tutorial\n- Git modules are no longer experimental\n  - Modules are added automatically as Git submodules when imported\n  - See the [Modules](https://uiua.org/tutorial/modules#git-modules) tutorial for more information\n- [`map`](https://uiua.org/docs/map) and related functions [`insert`](https://uiua.org/docs/insert), [`has`](https://uiua.org/docs/has), [`get`](https://uiua.org/docs/get), and [`remove`](https://uiua.org/docs/remove) are no longer experimental\n- Add the [`mask \u29b7`](https://uiua.org/docs/mask) function, which creates a mask of occurrences of one array in another\n  - This works similarly to [`find \u2315`](https://uiua.org/docs/find), but is better when you need a mask or to distinguish between adjacent occurrences\n- Change [`sine \u223f`](https://uiua.org/docs/sine)'s glyph\n  - `\u223f` is more representative of what it does\n  - Most circle glyphs like `\u25cb` are used for array functions or stack manipulation\n  - `\u25cb` will continue to work and will be formatted as `\u223f`\n- [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) [`join \u2282`](https://uiua.org/docs/join) now works with arrays of the same rank as long as the row count does not change\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`scan \\\\`](https://uiua.org/docs/scan) now works with [`equals =`](https://uiua.org/docs/equals) and [`not equals \u2260`](https://www.uiua.org/docs/not%20equals)\n- [`group \u2295`](https://uiua.org/docs/group) can now take multidimensional index arrays\n- [`partition \u229c`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) can now take multidimensional marker arrays\n- [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) and [`pick \u22a1`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) now work with duplicate indices if the values at those indices are the same\n- [`rotate \u21bb`](https://uiua.org/docs/rotate) now works through boxes\n- [`fold \u2227`](https://uiua.org/docs/fold) now works with [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) if its function does\n- [`inventory \u235a`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory) can now take 3 or more arrays\n- [`repeat \u2365`](https://uiua.org/docs/repeat) can now take non-scalar repetition counts\n  - This repeats the function a different number of times for each row of the inputs\n- [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) can now be used with [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) to separate into [`classify \u229b`](https://uiua.org/docs/classify) and [`deduplicate \u25f4`](https://uiua.org/docs/deduplicate)\n- Characters can now be [`multiply \u00d7`](https://uiua.org/docs/multiply)d or [`divide \u00f7`](https://uiua.org/docs/divide)d by numbers to possibly toggle their case\n- Add the [`csv`](https://uiua.org/docs/csv) function, which encodes and decodes CSV data\n- Add the [`&clget`](https://uiua.org/docs/&clget) and [`&clset`](https://uiua.org/docs/&clset) system functions, which allow copying and pasting text to and from the system clipboard\n- Add more [shadowable constants](https://www.uiua.org/docs/constants)\n- Importing modules that use the `# Experimental!` comment now requires the `# Experimental!` comment in the importing file\n- Doc comments may now be placed at the end of single-line functions\n- Non-alphabetic identifiers can now be suffixed with `!` to make macros\n- Add `df`, `ddf`, etc shortcuts for [`dip \u2299`](https://uiua.org/docs/dip) [`fix \u00a4`](https://uiua.org/docs/fix)\n- Existing macros are now called \"stack macros\" to distinguish them from the new \"array macros\"\n  - Stack macros are now [hygienic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro)\n- Add array macros, which allow code to be generated and manipulated at compile time as strings\n  - These are specified with a `^` immediately following a binding's arrow\n  - They are documented in the [Macros](https://uiua.org/tutorial/macros) tutorial\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`pop \u25cc`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop) can now be used to retrieve the [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) value\n  - See more details in [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill)'s documentation\n- Add the wildcard constant `W`, which matches any number, and `@\\W`, which matches any character\n  - These work well with [`match \u224d`](https://uiua.org/docs/match), [`find \u2315`](https://uiua.org/docs/find), and [`mask \u29b7`](https://uiua.org/docs/mask)\n- Add the experimental [`coordinate \u27d4`](https://uiua.org/docs/coordinate) function, which searches an array for a value and returns a multidimensional index\n  - [`coordinate \u27d4`](https://uiua.org/docs/coordinate) is to [`pick \u22a1`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) as [`indexof \u2297`](https://uiua.org/docs/indexof) is to [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select)\n- Experimental function strands now use the `\u203f` character, which formats from `__`\n- Add the experimental [`by \u22b8`](https://uiua.org/docs/by) modifier, which duplicates a function's last argument before calling it\n- Add the experimental [`quote`](https://uiua.org/docs/quote) modifier, which converts a string to code at compile time\n  - This is useful in array macros\n- Add `# No inline!` semantic comment, which prevents a function and its callers from being inlined\n  - This enables better stack traces on errors\n- Deprecate [`bind`](https://uiua.org/docs/bind)\n  - It undermines the priniciples of the language\n  - It makes certain optimizations impossible\n  - [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) and/or [`map`](https://uiua.org/docs/map) can be used to achieve similar effects\n- Deprecate [`deal`](https://uiua.org/docs/deal)\n  -

Instead, multiple groups are passed to the function.\r\n  - The reducing versions were rarely used\r\n  - This new behavior is more useful\r\n- **Breaking Change**: [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`json`](https://uiua.org/docs/json) no longer attempts to form multidimensional arrays\r\n  - This makes deserializing JSON more consistent\r\n- **Breaking Change**: [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill)ed [`scan \\\\`](https://uiua.org/docs/scan) now sets the initial value as well as filling row shapes\r\n  - This behavior is hard to get otherwise\r\n  - Fixes to existing code should be simple\r\n- **Breaking Change**: [`obverse \u2305`](https://uiua.org/docs/obverse) with a single function now just nullifies the inverse\r\n  - This makes a lot of common [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) patterns much simpler\r\n- **Breaking Change**: Negative indices to [`pick \u22a1`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) and [`select \u228f`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) now always use a fill value if available\r\n- Stabilize [subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts)!\r\n  - They make available a lot of nice functionality\r\n  - Allow negative subscripts\r\n  - Add experimental [sided subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts#sided)\r\n- [`rows \u2261`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows), [`inventory \u235a`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory), and [`each \u2235`](https://uiua.org/docs/each) now support subscripts\r\n- [`deshape \u266d`](https://uiua.org/docs/deshape) now supports subscripts\r\n  - Axes are collapsed to get the given rank\r\n- Deprecate [`rerank \u2607`](https://uiua.org/docs/rerank)\r\n  - It was basically always used with a static rank, and that functionality has been subsumed by subscripted [`deshape \u266d`](https://uiua.org/docs/deshape) and/or the iterating modifiers listed above\r\n  - The dynamic behavior can still be accessed with `\u00b0\u22b8(\u29fb\u25b3)` (though when you would need this is unclear)\r\n- Add the [`stencil \u29c8`](https://uiua.org/docs/stencil) modifier, which is a generalization of [`windows \u25eb`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)\r\n  - `\u29c8\u2218` is equivalent to [`windows \u25eb`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)\r\n  - [`windows \u25eb`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows) has been deprecated. All existing uses will continue to work and will be formatted as `\u29c8\u2218`.\r\n- [`get`](https://uiua.org/docs/get), [`has`](https://uiua.org/docs/has), and [`remove`](https://uiua.org/docs/remove) now support working on multiple key-value pairs at once\r\n- Deprecate [`trace \u2e2e`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)\r\n  - It is equivalent to subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack)\r\n  - Sequential `?`s, which formatted to [`trace \u2e2e`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)s, now format to subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack)\r\n- Stabilize [`tuples \u29c5`](https://uiua.org/docs/tuples)\r\n- Stabilize [`sort \u2346`](https://uiua.org/docs/sort)\r\n  - Sorting is a very common operation, and it's useful to have such simple access to it\r\n- Stabilize [`last \u22a3`](https://uiua.org/docs/last)\r\n  - Getting the last row is a very common operation\r\n- Stabilize [`case \u2369`](https://uiua.org/docs/case)\r\n- Add the [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path) modifier, which finds shortest paths\r\n  - Replaces and deprecates [`astar`](https://uiua.org/docs/astar)\r\n  - `astar`'s functionality is still available via [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path) with a function pack\r\n- Add the `A\u2081`, `A\u2082`, `A\u2083`, `C\u2082`, `C\u2083`, and `E\u2083` constants which are various kinds of adjacency offsets\r\n  - They are great for working with [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path)\r\n- Declared signatures that do not match the inferred signature will now cause a warning rather than an error\r\n  - The function is edited to make the signature correct\r\n- [`orient \u2938`](https://uiua.org/docs/orient) can now use [`fill \u2b1a`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) to fill in new dimensions\r\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce) (format string) now splits a string by a delimiter\r\n- [`do \u2362`](https://uiua.org/docs/do) now runs its functions at least once, even if their signatures are invalid\r\n  - This is helpful when initially setting up a loop\r\n- [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) now works with [`repeat \u2365`](https://uiua.org/docs/repeat) without a repetition count\r\n  - This counts the number of repetitions required to converge\r\n- Add an `\u03b5` shadowable constant for the machine epsilon\r\n  - You can type it as `\\\\epsilon`\r\n  - Other greek letters can also by typed this way\r\n- Add [`&ep`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ep) and [`&epf`](https://uiua.org/docs/&epf) system functions for easier printing to stderr\r\n- Functions that work with audio such as [`audio`](https://uiua.org/docs/audio) now treat the first axis as samples and the second axis as channels\r\n- Add [`# Deprecated!`](https://uiua.org/docs/semanticcomment#deprecated) semantic comments\r\n- Change [`backward \ud834\udd08`](https://uiua.org/docs/backward)'s glyph to `\ud834\udd08`. Code using `\u02dc` will continue to work and will be formatted as `\ud834\udd08`.\r\n- Add the experimental [`or \u2228`](https://uiua.org/docs/or) function\r\n  - It has a useful reduction identity\r\n  - It is also GCD\r\n- Add experimental [inline macros](https://www.uiua.org/docs/experimental#inline-macros)\r\n  - Deprecate the experimental `stringify` and `signature` modifiers in favor of inline code macros\r\n- Add experimental [`binary`](https://uiua.org/docs/binary) function, which encodes and decodes arrays into a compact binary representation\r\n- Add experimental [`&b`](https://uiua.org/docs/breakpoint) function, which pauses execution and prints the stack\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated `member \u220a` function\r\n  - As planned, [`memberof \u220a`](https://uiua.org/docs/memberof)'s glyph has been changed, and the old one will format to `\u220a`.\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `\u27d4 coordinate` function\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `struct` modifier\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated `setinv` and `setund` modifiers\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated `choose` and `permute` functions\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `\u25f9 triangle` modifier\r\n- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `\u2444 chunks` function\r\n### Interpreter\r\n- The compiler and interpreter have been almost entirely rewritten to use a tree-based execution model rather than a bytecode model\r\n  - This massively simplifies compilation as well as optimizations and the derivation of inverses\r\n  - This should not affect any language semantics\r\n- Improve pattern matching error messages\r\n- Optimize the \"root\" pattern `\u207f%:1`\r\n- Optimize format strings applied to strings or boxed strings\r\n- Optimize common [`partition \u229c`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) patterns\r\n- Add an `-e`/`--experimental` flag to the `uiua eval` command to enable experimental features\r\n- Add the `uiua check` command, which checks that Uiua files compile\r\n- More system functions are now run for output comments\r\n- Improve formatting of more complex arrays with format strings and [`&p`](https://uiua.org/docs/&p)\r\n### Website\r\n- Add a new pad setting to show line values to the right of the code\r\n- Add [Subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts) page\r\n- Update [More Stack Manipulation](https://uiua.org/tutorial/morestack) and [More Array Manipulation](https://uiua.org/tutorial/advancedarray) tutorials to include subscripts\r\n  - Change their titles from \"Advanced\" to \"More\"\r\n- Add new [Idioms](https://uiua.org/docs/idioms) page\r\n"

This makes its calling convention match [`memberof \u220a`](https://uiua.org/docs/memberof)\n  - It also matches the argument order of the more common case\n  - [`indexof \u2297`](https://uiua.org/docs/indexof) has been deprecated\n  - The formatter will automatically convert existing code\n- Deprecate experimental [`progressive indexof \u2298`](https://uiua.org/docs/progressiveindexof) in favor of [`occurrences \u29c6`](https://uiua.org/docs/occurrences)\n- Add the [`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential) function, which computes the exponential function\n- Deprecate [`logarithm \u2099`](https://uiua.org/docs/logarithm) in favor of [`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential)\n- Deprecate [`unique \u25f0`](https://uiua.org/docs/logarithm) in favor of subscripted [`occurrences \u29c6`](https://uiua.org/docs/occurrences)\n  - `\u25f0` will automatically format to `\u29c6\u2081`\n- Remove experimental `ln` in favor of [`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential)\n- Add [`&seek`](https://uiua.org/docs/&seek) function for working with large files\n- Calling [`&tcpa`](https://uiua.org/docs/&tcpa) on a TLS listener created with [`&tlsl`](https://uiua.org/docs/&tlsl) now automatically tries conducting a TSL handshake\n- Make subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack) merge adjacent non-subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack) chains\n- Implement [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)[`regex`](https://uiua.org/docs/regex) for replacing using regex (called `gsub` in some other languages)\n- Add functions to work with UDP:\n  - [`&udpb`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udpb) to bind a socket\n  - [`&udpr`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udpr) to receive a datagram\n  - [`&udps`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udps) to send a datagram\n  - [`&udpsml`](https://uiua.org/docs/&udpsml) to set the maximum message length\n- Rename `\u25ff modulus` to [`modulo \u25ff`](https://uiua.org/docs/modulo)\n  - \"Modulo\" is the correct term for the operation this function conducts\n- Add [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) and [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) capability to [`&cd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&cd)\n  - [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`&cd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&cd) will output the current working directory\n  - [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)[`&cd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&cd) will return to the original directory afterward\n- Add experimental [`reciprocal \u2a2a`](https://uiua.org/docs/reciprocal) function, which computes the multiplicative inverse AKA reciprocal of a number\n- Add experimental [`recur`](https://uiua.org/docs/recur) modifier, which generalizes recursive algorithms\n  - This would replace existing recursive functions\n- Add experimental [data functions](https://www.uiua.org/docs/experimental#data-functions) with optional arguments\n  - Remove existing experimental non-tacit data functions and methods\n  - [`layout`](https://uiua.org/docs/layout) and [`voxels`](https://uiua.org/docs/voxels) now use this system for configuration\n- `@\\_` and `@\\W` now roundtrip through [`pretty`](https://uiua.org/docs/pretty) and [`repr`](https://uiua.org/docs/repr) (previously they would be formatted as `@\\x\u00af01` and `@\ufffd` respectively)\n- Remove previously deprecated `signature` and `stringify` modifiers\n### Interpreter\n- Many bug and crash fixes\n- Emit a diagnostic when most modifiers are not provided enough arguments\n- Emit a diagnostic for redundant subscripts\n- [`below \u25e1`](https://uiua.org/docs/below) now accepts noadic and dyadic functions\n  - An advice/style diagnostic will be emitted\n- Speed up the implementation of [`or \u2228`](https://uiua.org/docs/or)\n- The fomatter no longer truncates trailing decimal `0`s from number literals\n- Implement filled adjacent [`stencil \u29c8`](https://uiua.org/docs/stencil)\n- Optimize `=1\u29fb\u25f4`\n- Remove `rkok` alias and change `kork` to format to `\u25bd\u2082`\n- Add `each` alias for `\u2261\u2080`\n- Add `elem` alias for `\u220a`\n- Add `log` alias for [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`exponential \u2091`](https://uiua.org/docs/exponential)\n- Add `set` alias for [`un \u00b0`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`by \u22b8`](https://uiua.org/docs/by)\n- Improve \"Array would be too large\" error messages\n- Change short form of the `--experimental` flag for `uiua eval` to use `-x` instead of `-e`\n  - This is consistent with the corresponding flag for `uiua repl`\n- Remove the `\u207f\u00f7:1` (\"root\" pattern) optimization\n  - It inverted incorrectly when used with [`under \u235c`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)\n  - Existing uses should be replaced with [`anti \u231d`](https://uiua.org/docs/anti)[`power \u207f`](https://uiua.org/docs/power)\n### Pad\n- Add `primitives.json` to the pre-included files in the pad\n"
